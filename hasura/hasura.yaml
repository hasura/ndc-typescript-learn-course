# A build profile defines an environment, where to locate the supergraph 
# resources and how HML files are related to subgraphs in that environment. 
# You can create different build profiles for different environments, like 
# development, staging or production and each may reference environment specific
# resources. We have created this build profile for you to get you started.
buildProfiles:
  - build-profile.yaml

# Note that the required default build profile is the one which is used to 
# create a build when no profile has been explicitly specified.
